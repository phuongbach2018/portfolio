         <p>
		 Hanoi is the capital of Vietnam and the country's second largest
		 city by population. The population in 2015 was estimated at 7.7 
		 million people. The city lies on the right bank of the Red River.
		 Hanoi is 1,760 km (1,090 mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City and 120 km
		 (75 mi) west of Haiphong.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Hanoi is sometimes dubbed the "Paris of the East" for its French 
		 influences. With its tree-fringed boulevards, more than two dozen 
		 lakes and thousands of French colonial-era buildings, Hanoi is a 
		 popular tourist destination.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The tourist destinations in Hanoi are generally grouped into two 
		 main areas: the Old Quarter and the French Quarter(s). The "Old 
		 Quarter" is in the northern half of Hoàn Kiếm District with small
		 street blocks and alleys, and a traditional Vietnamese atmosphere.
		 Many streets in the Old Quarter have names signifying the goods the
		 local merchants were or are specialized in. For example, "Hàng Bạc" 
		 (silver stores) still have many stores specializing in trading silver
		 and jewelries.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Two areas are generally called the "French Quarters": the governmental
		 area in Ba Đình District and the south of Hoàn Kiếm District. Both areas 
		 have distinctive French Colonial style villas and broad tree-lined avenues.
		 The political center of Vietnam, Ba Đình has a high concentration of 
		 Vietnamese government headquarters, including the Presidential Palace, 
		 the National Assembly and several ministries and embassies, most of which
		 used administrative buildings of colonial French Indochina. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The One Pillar Pagoda, the Lycée du Protectorat and the Ho Chi Minh 
		 Mausoleum are also in Ba Dinh. South of Hoàn Kiếm's "French Quarter" has
		 several French-Colonial landmarks, including the Hanoi Opera House, the
		 Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel, the National Museum of Vietnamese 
		 History (formerly the École française d'Extrême-Orient), and the St. Joseph's 
		 Cathedral. Most of the French-Colonial buildings in Hoan Kiem are now used
		 as foreign embassies.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Since 2014, Hanoi has consistently been voted in the world's top ten
		 destinations by TripAdvisor. It ranked 8th in 2014, 4th in 2015 and
		 8th in 2016. Hanoi is the most affordable international destination in
		 TripAdvisor's annual TripIndex report. In 2017, Hanoi will welcome more 
		 than 5 million international tourists.
