         <h1>Ho Chi Minh City</h1>
              
		 <p>
		 Ho Chi Minh City, also known by its former name of Saigon,
		 is the largest city in Vietnam by population. It was known
		 as Prey Nokor prior to annexation by the Vietnamese in the 
		 17th century. Under the name Saigon, it was the capital of
		 the French colony of Cochinchina and later of the independent 
		 republic of South Vietnam 1955–75. On 2 July 1976, Saigon 
		 merged with the surrounding Gia Định Province and was officially 
		 renamed Ho Chi Minh City after revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Today, the city's core is still adorned with wide elegant 
		 boulevards and historic French colonial buildings. The majority 
		 of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short
		 leisurely distance from each other. The most prominent structures 
		 in the city centre are the Reunification Palace, City Hall,
		 Municipal Theatre, City Post Office, State Bank Office, City 
		 People's Court and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Some of the historic 
		 hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial 
		 era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for
		 American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum,
		 Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum 
		 of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum 
		 of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial 
		 House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude
		 of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as phở or rice
		 vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the "Western 
		 Quarter" on Phạm Ngũ Lão Street and Bùi Viện Street, District 1.
		 As the international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6
		 million tourists in 2017
