         <h1>Phu Quoc</h1>
         <p>
		 Phú Quốc is the largest island in Vietnam. Phú Quốc and
		 nearby islands, along with distant Thổ Chu Islands, is part 
		 of Kiên Giang Province as Phú Quốc District, the island has 
		 a total area of 574 square kilometres (222 sq mi) and a permanent 
		 population of approximately 103,000. Located in the Gulf of 
		 Thailand, the district of Phú Quốc includes the island proper 
		 and 21 smaller islets.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The economy is centred on fishing, agriculture and a fast-growing
		 tourism sector. Phu Quoc has achieved fast economic growth due to
		 its current tourism boom. Many infrastructure projects have been
		 carried out, including several five-star hotels and resorts. Phu Quoc
		 International Airport is the hub connecting Phú Quốc with mainland 
		 Vietnam and other international destinations.
         </p>
		 <p>
		 Phu Quoc is famous for its two traditional products: fish sauce and
		 black pepper. The rich fishing grounds offshore provides the anchovy
		 catch from which the prized sauce is made. Pepper cultivation is 
		 located inland in the center of the island. More recently a pearl 
		 farm was established.
		 </p>
         <p>
		 Phu Quoc was served by Phu Quoc Airport with air links to Ho Chi Minh City
		 , Ha noi, Rach Gia, Can Tho. Phu Quoc Airport was closed and replaced by
		 the new Phu Quoc International Airport from December 2, 2012. Phu Quoc
		 is also linked with Rach Gia and Hà Tiên by fast ferry hydrofoils.
		 Many domestic and international projects related to tourism have been 
		 carried out, including latest direct flight from Bangkok to Phu Quoc 
		 by Bangkok Airways, which could make Phú Quốc a new tourist hub in
		 Southeast Asia.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resorts in combination with the opening of the new 
		 Vinmec Phu Quoc International Hospital in June 2015, Phu Quoc will 
		 add an additional source of revenue to the local economy in terms 
		 of medical services, medical tourism, and medical education.
