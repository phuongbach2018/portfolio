         <h1>Ha Long Bay</h1>
         
         <p>
		 Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and popular travel 
		 destination in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam. The name Hạ Long means 
		 "descending dragon". Administratively, the bay belongs to Ha Long City,
		 Cam Pha City, and is a part of Van Don District. The bay features 
		 thousands of limestone karsts and isles in various shapes and sizes.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Ha Long Bay is a center of a larger zone which includes Bai Tu Long Bay
		 to the northeast, and Cat Ba Island to the southwest. These larger zones
		 share a similar geological, geographical, geomorphological, climate, and 
		 cultural characters.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Ha Long Bay has an area of around 1,553 km2, including 1,960–2,000 islets, 
		 most of which are limestone. The core of the bay has an area of 334 km2 with
		 a high density of 775 islets. The limestone in this bay has gone through
		 500 million years of formation in different conditions and environments. 
		 The evolution of the karst in this bay has taken 20 million years under 
		 the impact of the tropical wet climate. The geo-diversity of the environment
		 in the area has created biodiversity, including a tropical evergreen biosystem,
		 oceanic and sea shore biosystem. Ha Long Bay is home to 14 endemic floral 
		 species and 60 endemic faunal species.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 In 1962, the Vietnam Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism designated 
		 Ha Long Bay a 'Renowned National Landscape Monument'.
		 Ha Long Bay was first listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994,
		 in recognition of its outstanding, universal aesthetic value. In 2000 
		 the World Heritage Committee additionally recognised Ha Long Bay for its 
		 outstanding geological and geomorphological value, and its World Heritage
		 Listing was updated.
		 In 2012, New 7 Wonders Foundation officially named Ha Long Bay as one 
		 of New Seven Natural Wonders of the world.
		 Ha Long Bay is also a member of the Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of
		 the World.
